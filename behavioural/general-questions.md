## Behavioural Questions

**1. What are your major weakness?**

I am still relatively new to the Software Engineering field, and I see my lack of experience as an opportunity to learn and grow. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set.
One more key area, where i am improving myself is like, I have seen my seniors that whenever some tough situation comes, they handles the situation very very calmly. There is not a single sign of stress in their face ever. They very gently handles such scenarios and provides a solution for that. So I am still learning the art of working calmly and peacefully under the pressure.

**2. Did you ever had a conflict with your manager and how did you handled that?**

There was a time when my manager and I had a disagreement about the prioritization of tasks for me. I felt that certain tasks were more important and needed to be completed first, but my manager had a different opinion. Instead of getting into a heated argument, I scheduled a meeting with my manager to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I presented my point of view and the reasons why I thought the tasks I prioritized were important. After listening to my perspective, my manager understood my point of view and we were able to come to a compromise. We were able to prioritize the tasks.

**3. Did you ever face any challenges in the project, and how did you handled that?**

I have faced several challenges in my projects, but I always approach them with a problem-solving attitude. For example, once, I was working with a tight deadline and I faced unexpected issues with the code, which was written by the previous team. I had to quickly identify the root cause of the problem and come up with a solution. I reached out to my senior for help and together we were able to debug the code and meet the deadline successfully.

While I was working on current project, I realized that the documentation was not clear and complete, due to which a large number of bugs were being reported in higher environments like: SIT & UAT. It was also difficult for me to understand the documentation and compare the current code implementation with it. Then I took it forward with my manager and explain the current issue, which we are facing. After the discussion, I took the initiative to document the system and did a re-verification of the areas, where bugs were being reported in majority. This approach actually worked very well and we are able to reduce the bugs count by 60 to 70%.


**4. Why do you want to join us?**

I am excited about the opportunity to join the organization because I believe that my skills and experience align well with the company's goals and values. I am pretty comfortable with the role, that is going to be provided to me in the organization. From my research, I understood that the organization is focused on providing the research to the clients and then also help them to implement and execute the research outcomes. I am particularly impressed with the work that the organization does. I am confident that my problome solving skills & knowledge would be valuable in contributing to the company's success and achieving those goals, which will take the organization further in delivering better customer experience.

**5. You have 60 days notice period. Will you not join any other company in this notice period?**

I understand that my notice period is 60 days and I am committed to fulfilling that period to the best of my ability. I believe that it is important to fulfill my obligations to my current employer and ensure a smooth transition for any projects or responsibilities I am currently handling. During this time, I will not be actively seeking other job opportunities and will be fully focused on fulfilling my notice period with my current employer.
