# Adjacency Matrix Representation

In graph theory, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix that represents a graph. The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the vertices of the graph, and the entry in row i and column j represents the presence or absence of an edge between vertices i and j.

**For an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric**, since the presence of an edge between vertices i and j is the same as the presence of an edge between vertices j and i. For a directed graph, the adjacency matrix need not be symmetric, since the presence of an edge from vertex i to vertex j is not necessarily the same as the presence of an edge from vertex j to vertex i.

The adjacency matrix is often denoted by A, and the entry in row i and column j is denoted by A[i,j]. If there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, then A[i,j] = 1. Otherwise, A[i,j] = 0.

In some cases, the adjacency matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs, where the weight of the edge between vertices i and j is stored in A[i,j] instead of 1 or 0.

The adjacency matrix representation of a graph has several advantages, such as easy implementation of graph algorithms, fast access to edge information, and efficient storage of dense graphs. However, it can be inefficient for sparse graphs, since it requires O(n^2) space, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. In such cases, an adjacency list representation is often preferred.

**How to handle vertices with arbitary Names?**

- Lets assume, we have four cities, ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL.
- We can maintain an array of String, which will be like this: [ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL].
- Now each city is assigned an index, this index we can use to use in Matrix.
- For Efficient implementation, a hash table also would be required to do reverse mapping. i.e. {ABC:0, DEF:1, GHI:2, JKL:3}

**Properties of Adjacency Matrix Representation:**
- Space Required: θ(V * V)
- Operations:
    - Check if u and v are adjacent: θ(1)
    - Find all vertices adjacent to u: θ(V)
    - Find degree of u: θ(V)
    - Add/Remove an Edge: θ(1)
    - Add/Remove a Vertex: θ(V*V) (Because we need to create a bigger matrix and copying values in it)
