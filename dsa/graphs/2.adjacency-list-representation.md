# Adjacency List Representation

In graph theory, an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists, one for each vertex in the graph. The lists contain the neighbors of each vertex, i.e., the vertices that are adjacent to it in the graph.

For an undirected graph, each edge is represented twice in the adjacency list, once for each of its endpoints. For a directed graph, the adjacency list only contains the neighbors of each vertex that can be reached by following an outgoing edge.

The adjacency list representation is often denoted by A, and A[i] contains a list of the neighbors of vertex i. The list can be implemented using an array, linked list, or other data structure.

In some cases, the adjacency list can also store the weights of the edges, along with the neighboring vertices. This is useful for weighted graphs, where each edge has a weight that represents the cost or distance between its endpoints.

The adjacency list representation of a graph has several advantages, such as efficient storage of sparse graphs, easy iteration over the neighbors of each vertex, and fast access to edge information. However, it can be slower than the adjacency matrix representation for dense graphs, since it requires O(m + n) space, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph. In such cases, an adjacency matrix representation is often preferred.

In adjacency List, We have an array of List (ArrayList or LinkedList).

Example: `[[1,2], [0,2], [0,1,3], [2]]`.

- At 0 Index We have `[1,2]`, so Vertex 0 is connected with 1 and 2.
- At 1 Index We have `[0,2]`, so Vertex 1 is connected with 0 and 2.
- At 2 Index we have `[0,1,3]`, so Vertex 2 is connected with 0,1 and 3.
- At 3 index we have `[2]`, so Vertex 3 is connected with 2.


**Properties of Adjacency List Representation:**

- Space: θ(V + E) {Undirected = θ(V + 2E) Directed= θ(V + E)}
- Operations:
    - Check if there is an edge from u to v: θ(V)
    - Find all adjacent of u: θ(deg(u))
    - Find degree of u: θ(1)
    - Add an edge: θ(1)
    - Remove an edge: O(V)
