## Design Patterns Introduction

Design patterns are a set of best practices and solutions to common software design problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to solve recurring problems in a consistent, efficient and maintainable way.

There are several types of design patterns, but the most commonly recognized are:

**1. Creational patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include the Singleton, Factory, and Abstract Factory patterns.

**2. Structural patterns:** These patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. Examples include the Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator patterns.

**3. Behavioral patterns:** These patterns deal with communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together. Examples include the Observer, Command, and State patterns.

**4. Concurrency patterns:** These patterns deal with multi-threaded programming and concurrency control. Examples include the Monitor Object, Balking, and Double-Checked Locking patterns.

**5. Archtictural Patterns:** These patterns deal with the high-level structure of a software system, and the distribution of responsibility among its components. Examples include the Model-View-Controller, Client-Server, and Microservices architecture patterns.
