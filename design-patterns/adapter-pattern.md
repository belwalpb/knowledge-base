## Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It provides a way to convert the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.

In Java, the Adapter pattern can be implemented by creating a class that implements the target interface and wraps an instance of the adaptee class. The Adapter class forwards requests to the adaptee class and translates the adaptee's responses into a format that the client can understand.

Here is an example of the Adapter pattern in Java:

```java
interface Target {
    void request();
}

class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        // code to perform the specific request
    }
}

class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Target` interface defines a request method that the client expects. The Adaptee class has a `specificRequest` method that the client cannot use directly because it has a different interface. The Adapter class implements the Target interface and wraps an instance of the Adaptee class. When the client calls the request method on the Adapter, it forwards the call to the specificRequest method of the Adaptee class. The Adapter class thus adapts the Adaptee class to the Target interface.

It's important to note that the Adapter pattern is a way to provide a different interface for an existing class, it's not a way to extend functionality.


The Adapter pattern can be used in a variety of situations, but it is typically used in the following scenarios:

1. When you need to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of your code. By using an adapter, you can convert the interface of the existing class to the interface that you need.

2. When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes that don't have compatible interfaces. The adapter can act as a bridge between the two classes, allowing them to work together.

3. When you want to add functionality to an existing class, but don't want to modify the class itself. By using an adapter, you can add the functionality you need without modifying the existing class.

4. When you need to work with third-party libraries that have different interfaces than the ones you are used to. You can use an adapter to convert the interface of the third-party library to a more familiar interface.

5. When you need to work with legacy code that has an outdated or otherwise incompatible interface. Instead of modifying the legacy code, you can use an adapter to convert its interface to a more modern one.

6. It's important to note that the Adapter pattern is a way to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It's not a way to add functionality to a class, for that purpose you can use Decorator pattern.
