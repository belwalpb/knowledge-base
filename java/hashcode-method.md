## Java hashCode() Method:

The hashCode() method in Java is a method that is defined in the Object class, which is the superclass of all classes in Java. The hashCode() method returns an integer value that represents the hash code of an object. The hash code is a unique value that is generated based on the state of an object. It's used to determine the equality of objects and to identify objects in a hash-based data structure, such as a HashMap or HashSet.

The hashCode() method is used by the JVM to determine the location of an object in memory. When an object is stored in a hash-based data structure, the JVM uses the hash code of the object to determine where it should be stored in memory.

The hashCode() method is also used by the equals() method to determine whether two objects are equal or not. If the hash codes of two objects are different, then the objects are guaranteed to be different, so the equals() method does not need to be called. This can improve the performance of operations that involve searching for or comparing objects in a hash-based data structure.

The default implementation of the hashCode() method provided by the Object class is based on the memory address of the object. However, it's highly recommended that classes that override the equals() method also override the hashCode() method so that it returns a value based on the state of the object.

It's also important to note that two distinct objects can have the same hashCode, this is known as hash collision, that's why in some cases, the equals method should be used to determine the equality of the elements.
