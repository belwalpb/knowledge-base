# Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream, and deserialization is the process of recreating the object from a byte stream. This allows objects to be easily saved to a file or sent over a network. In order for a class to be serializable, it must implement the java.io.Serializable interface. However, it's worth noting that not all objects should be serializable, for example, objects with resources such as file handles should not be serialized.

## serialVersionUID

The serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a serializable class. It is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender's class, then deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException.

The serialVersionUID can be generated by the serialver tool that comes with the JDK, or it can be defined explicitly by the developer.
If it is not explicitly defined, the serialVersionUID is generated based on various aspects of the class, such as its name, implemented interfaces, and methods. If the class is modified in any way that affects the serialization process, a new serialVersionUID should be generated.
