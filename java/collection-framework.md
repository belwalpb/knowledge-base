**Collection:** A group of individual objects which can be represented as a single unit is known as the collection.

Advantages:
1. It includes various useful data structures, such as lists, sets, maps, queues, and stacks, that can be used to store and manage data efficiently.
2. It provides many utility methods for performing common operations on collections, such as sorting, searching, and filtering.
3. It supports generics, which allows you to specify the type of objects that a collection can hold, making your code more type-safe and easier to read.

#### Interfaces that Collections Interface extends:

1. **Iterable Interface:** This is the root interface for the entire collection framework. The collection interface extends the iterable interface. Therefore, inherently, all the interfaces and classes implement this interface. The main functionality of this interface is to provide an iterator for the collections.


#### Operations that Collection Interface Declares:
1. boolean add(E element);
2. boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
3. void clear()
4. boolean contains(Object o)
5. boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
6. boolean equals(Object o)
7. int 	hashCode();
8. int 	size()
9. boolean 	remove(Object o)
10. boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)


#### List Interface in Java

The List interface in Java provides a way to store the ordered collection. It is a child interface of Collection. It is an ordered collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored. Since List preserves the insertion order, it allows positional access and insertion of elements. 

**Implementation of List Interface in Java:**

**1. ArrayList:** It is the resizable-array implementation of the List interface. The `size`, `isEmpty`, `get`, `set`, `iterator`, and `listIterator` operations run in constant time.

The `add` operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires `O(n)` time.

In Java, an ArrayList grows by allocating a new, larger array and copying the elements from the old array to the new one. The new array is typically larger than the old one to reduce the number of times this operation needs to be performed as elements are added to the list.

The specific growth strategy used by ArrayList is to increase the size of the array by a factor of 1.5. For example, if the current array has a length of 10, then a new array of length 15 will be created when more space is needed.

When you add an element to an ArrayList, the ArrayList will first check if there is any room left in the current array to store the new element. If there is, the element is added to the next available position in the array. If there is no room, a new array is created with the new size and all the elements of the current array are copied to it. Then the new element is added to the end of the new array.

In general, this approach of periodically increasing the size of the array to be slightly larger than the current number of elements in the list allows the ArrayList to keep the average cost of adding an element to O(1) amortized performance.
