**Collection:** A group of individual objects which can be represented as a single unit is known as the collection.

Advantages:
1. It includes various useful data structures, such as lists, sets, maps, queues, and stacks, that can be used to store and manage data efficiently.
2. It provides many utility methods for performing common operations on collections, such as sorting, searching, and filtering.
3. It supports generics, which allows you to specify the type of objects that a collection can hold, making your code more type-safe and easier to read.

#### Interfaces that Collections Interface extends:

1. **Iterable Interface:** This is the root interface for the entire collection framework. The collection interface extends the iterable interface. Therefore, inherently, all the interfaces and classes implement this interface. The main functionality of this interface is to provide an iterator for the collections.


#### Operations that Collection Interface Declares:
1. boolean add(E element);
2. boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
3. void clear()
4. boolean contains(Object o)
5. boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
6. boolean equals(Object o)
7. int 	hashCode();
8. int 	size()
9. boolean 	remove(Object o)
10. boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)


**The Java Collection Framework provides several important classes for storing and manipulating data, including:**

**1. ArrayList:** an implementation of a dynamic array, allowing for fast random access and insertion/deletion at the end.

**2. LinkedList:** an implementation of a doubly-linked list, allowing for fast insertion/deletion at any point in the list.

**3. HashMap:** an implementation of a hash table, allowing for fast access and insertion/deletion of key-value pairs.

4. TreeMap: an implementation of a balanced binary tree, allowing for fast access and insertion/deletion of key-value pairs in a sorted order.

5. HashSet: an implementation of a set using a hash table, allowing for fast insertion/deletion of unique elements.
6. TreeSet: an implementation of a set using a balanced binary tree, allowing for fast insertion/deletion of unique elements in a sorted order.
7. Vector: a legacy class similar to ArrayList, but with additional synchronization for use in multi-threaded environments.
8. Stack: a legacy class representing a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack of objects.
9. PriorityQueue : An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap.
10. Deque: A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
