# Object Oriented Programming:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs that's based on the idea of creating "objects" that have specific properties and behaviors.

OOP can create these objects with specific characteristics and behaviors, and then use them to build more complex programs. This can make it easier to organize and manage our code, and can make it easier to reuse code in different parts of our program.

### OOP Terminologies:

**1. Encapsulation:** It deals in bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It helps in data hiding and avoids data being accessed from outside the class without proper methods. It ensures that data attributes does not reaches any unintentional state.

In Java, We can achieve encapsulation by defining the class attributes as private and providing public methods (setters and getters) to access those attributes using a well-defined procedure only.

**2. Abstraction:** This concept refers to exposing the essential features/methods only of an object, while hiding the non-essential features from outsider world.

In Java, abstraction can be implemented using `Abstract Class` or `Interfaces`. Abstract Class or Interfaces provides a blueprint of a class

In Java We can achieve abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class or interface defines the essential features that a child class must implement and expose them to outsider world.

**3. Inheritance:** This concept allows creating new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from the existing classes. It helps in code reusability and improving code organization.

In Java, We can achieve inheritance using the "extends" keyword. A child class can inherit the properties and methods of the parent class using the "super" keyword.


**4. Polymorphism:** This concept allows an object to take on many forms. It means that a single method or object can have multiple implementations, depending on the context in which it is used.

In Java, We can achieve polymorphism using method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading allows creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding allows creating a new implementation of a method in a child class.
