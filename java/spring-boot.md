# Spring Boot:

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create microservices and web applications. It is built on top of the Spring framework and provides a simplified way to configure and run Spring-based applications. It reduces the amount of configuration and setup required for a Spring-based project, making it easier to get started with building web and microservices applications. Additionally, it provides a number of useful features such as embedded servers, automatic configuration, and easy integration with other Spring projects.

## Common Questions:

**1. What is Spring Boot?**

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create microservices and web applications. It is built on top of the Spring framework and provides a simplified way to configure and run Spring-based applications.

**2. What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?**

It reduces the amount of configuration and setup required for a Spring-based project.
It provides a number of useful features such as embedded servers, automatic configuration, and easy integration with other Spring projects.
It enables the development of production-ready applications quickly and easily.
How does Spring Boot simplify the development of a Spring-based application?
Spring Boot simplifies the development of a Spring-based application by providing a set of defaults and conventions, which can be overridden as needed. This reduces the amount of configuration and setup required for a Spring-based project and allows developers to focus on writing business logic.

**3. Can you explain the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?**

Spring is a Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It offers a wide range of features for developing enterprise applications. Spring Boot is a module of Spring that provides a simplified way to configure and run Spring-based applications. It reduces the amount of configuration and setup required for a Spring-based project and provides useful features such as embedded servers and automatic configuration.

**4. What are the different types of Spring Boot starters and their use cases?**

Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that can be included in a project to enable a particular set of functionality.
There are starters for different functionalities such as spring-boot-starter-web for web applications, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for database access, spring-boot-starter-test for testing, and so on.
By including these starters, developers can easily include the necessary dependencies for a particular functionality, without having to manually manage the dependencies.
How does Spring Boot handle configuration?
Spring Boot uses a combination of convention over configuration and auto-configuration to handle configuration. It provides a set of default configuration options that can be overridden as needed. Additionally, it provides an annotation-based approach to configure various aspects of the application, such as beans, properties, and profiles.

**5. How does Spring Boot handle security?**

Spring Boot provides a number of security features out-of-the-box, including authentication and authorization. It supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, such as form-based, basic, and token-based authentication. It also provides a number of options for securing web applications, such as securing specific URLs, using HTTPS, and setting up access controls.

**6. How can we deploy a Spring Boot application?**
Spring Boot applications can be deployed in a variety of ways, including:

Packaging the application as a jar or war file and deploying it to an application server such as Tomcat or Wildfly.
Using an embedded server, such as Tomcat or Jetty, included in the application and running it as a standalone application.
Deploying the application to a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
Using a containerization technology like Docker to deploy the application.

**7. What are the common Spring Boot Annotations?**

@SpringBootApplication : This annotation is used to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning. It is a combination of three annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

@Configuration : This annotation is used to indicate that a class defines a configuration for the application. Beans can be defined in such configuration classes using the @Bean annotation.

@EnableAutoConfiguration : This annotation is used to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It automatically configures the application based on the dependencies that are present on the classpath.

@ComponentScan : This annotation is used to enable component scanning in Spring Boot applications. It is used to search for and register beans within the package of the annotated class, and its sub-packages.

@RestController : This annotation is used to create a RESTful web service controller. It is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations.

@Controller : This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a Spring MVC controller. It is used to handle HTTP requests and return a response.

@Service : This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a service class. It is used to define business logic and can be injected into other components.

@Repository : This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a data access object. It is used to interact with the database and can be injected into other components.

@Autowired : This annotation is used to indicate that a field or a method parameter should be auto-wired with a bean from the Spring context.

@Value : This annotation is used to inject a property value from the application.properties or application.yml file into a field.

@Scheduled : This annotation is used to schedule a method to be invoked at fixed intervals or on a specific cron schedule.

@Async : This annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed asynchronously.

@Transactional : This annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed within a transaction.

@EnableScheduling : This annotation is used to enable scheduling of methods in Spring Boot applications.

@EnableAsync : This annotation is used to enable asynchronous execution of methods in Spring Boot applications.

**8. What is the difference between @Configuration and @Component?**

`@Component` is used to mark a class as a candidate for component scanning and can be used to indicate that a class is a general-purpose component of the application, while `@Configuration` is used to indicate that a class defines a configuration for the application and it is used to define beans and their dependencies using Java code.

**9. What are the scope of beans in spring boot?**

In Spring Boot, beans can have different scopes, which determine the lifecycle and number of instances of the bean that are created within the application. The following are the main scopes of beans in Spring Boot:

**1. singleton :** This is the default scope for a bean. Only one instance of the bean is created for the entire application and it is shared among all the objects that require it.

**2. prototype :** A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested. This scope is useful for objects that are not meant to be shared among multiple objects.

**3. request :** A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request. This scope is only available for web applications and is useful for objects that are specific to a single request.

**4. session :** A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session. This scope is only available for web applications and is useful for objects that are specific to a single session.

**5. application :** A single instance of the bean is created for a ServletContext and it is shared among all the objects that require it. This scope is only available for web applications.

**6. websocket :** A new instance of the bean is created for each WebSocket session. This scope is only available for web applications and is useful for objects that are specific to a single WebSocket session.
